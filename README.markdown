# omerta

Omerta is a simple blog platform using Mongo Mapper, MongoDB and Padrino. It will be fully unit tested and simple to use. You will be able to run multiple blogs off the platform.  It will not be a replacement for things like WordPress, but instead be a great robust starting point to expand on for more detailed blogging platforms.
